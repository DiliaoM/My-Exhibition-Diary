# 🖼️ My Exhibition Diary

**My Exhibition Diary** is a personal project for recording, organizing, and revisiting art exhibitions from around the world.  
It's designed as a minimalist, private space for art lovers to collect and track exhibitions they've attended or wish to see — current, upcoming, or past.

> ✨ Think of it as a personalized "exhibition wishlist" and memory archive.
